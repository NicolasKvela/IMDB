# IMDB
This code trains a model to tell if a movie review is positive or negative. It loads the IMDB dataset and keeps the top 20,000 words. Then it pads all reviews to the same length. The model uses layers like embedding, bidirectional LSTM, dropout, and a final dense layer. It trains the model for 5 rounds and checks its accuracy. At the end, thereâ€™s a function to test a new review by turning the words into numbers and making a prediction. This Code was made with the help of Chat and helped me make it even stronger. 
At this point this is already our thrid project and im starting to get the jist of it. Sometimes whenver the code does not run is usally when something needs to be installed which takes like a minute or two, but then it should urn smoothly especially with the help of Chat. After it ran I trie to make a few tweks to increase the rating which worked a tad.
